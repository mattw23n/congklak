Round-Robin Tournament: The most robust method is a round-robin tournament where every algorithm plays against every other algorithm a set number of times. This creates a statistically significant dataset of wins, losses, and draws. For example, if you have four AIs (A, B, C, D), you would run games of A vs B, A vs C, A vs D, B vs C, B vs D, and C vs D, each for perhaps 100 matches, with players alternating who goes first to eliminate first-move bias.

Performance Metrics: For each match, record the following:

Win/Loss/Draw Rate: This is the primary metric. Calculate the win rate of each AI against all opponents.

Average Move Time: Measures the computational efficiency of the algorithm. An algorithm that wins but takes 10 seconds per move may not be practical. This is especially important for Iterative Deepening, which is designed to manage time.

Game Length: The average number of moves per game can give you insights into the style of play. AIs that end games quickly might be more aggressive.

Elo Rating System: For a more comprehensive ranking, consider implementing an Elo rating system. Elo is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitor-versus-competitor games. It's used in chess, Go, and many other competitive games. Each AI starts with a base rating, and their rating changes after each game based on whether they won or lost against a higher or lower-rated opponent. This provides a single, dynamic measure of an AI's skill relative to the others.
